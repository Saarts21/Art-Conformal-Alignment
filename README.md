# Art-Conformal-Alignment

Our project deals with applying conforaml alignment such as presented in the article "Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees" on the task of artist imitation using generative models.
In our git you can find both the relevant notebooks needed to construct the dataset and the ones used to test the main algorithm from the article on our setting.
