# Art-Conformal-Alignment

Our project deals with applying conformal alignment such as presented in the paper "Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees" on the task of artist imitation using generative models.
In our Git repository you can find both the relevant notebooks needed to construct the dataset and those used to test the main algorithm from the article on our setting.
